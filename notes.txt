# Video Notes

## 0. zone to zone trading

- identifying support/resistance levels
- a price level that's important on a higher time frame is equally if not more important on a lower timeframe
- that's why we start analysis on weekly chart, then we go lower

- path of least resistence


## box1:

2:00 - what are zones
6:08 - boxes define the periods in time where the asset is not trending
and helps us define the price range in which its not trending


## Box2:
00:48 - two main indicators, 9 day MA, 50 day MA
01:09 - markets are fractals. what happens on one timeframe happens on another timeframe.
01:39 - 9 MA is short term momentum filter
01:52 - 50 MA is med term momemtum filter
02:05 - If the price falls below 9MA, short term momemtum is dying down
02:31 - only take box breakouts long if the price is above the 50 MA
02:44 - only take box breakouts short if the price is below the 50 MA
02:57 - we don't take breakouts when the price is against the med term momentum average
04:16 - price within boxes are like a coiled spring. The more it consolidates the more energy it collects.
04:09 - The bigger the box, the bigger the breakout will be. The longer the price will run because it has more energy.
04:28 - This box (ROKU, 19 Aug '19 - 11 Aug '20) developed over months - that's a base box.
04:43 - From these comes out the most beautiful trends that run for a long time.
04:50 - Once the price starts trending, price ran, then the trend structure broke down - and then it had to consolidate again in a non-trending phase
05:25 - The 50MA on the daily corresponds roughly to the 9MA on the weekly
05:37 - 2nd type of box we usually see are 50MA (daily) boxes
05:52 - 1st box - Base box. 2nd box - 50MA box. 3rd one - smallest  9MA boxes
06:10 - (9MA boxes) you see them all the time
07:03 - Three types of boxes - 50MA box, base box, 9MA box.
Most reliable one in breakout scenario is 50MA box
The problem with base boxes the price can go out a little bit, come back and keep chopping
07:25 - For 50 MA box, the first 50MA box after a breakout, that's extremely reliable. The price just goes.

## Box 3:
- system objectives

## Box 4:
0:00
- what kind of trades based on the type of box
- how to use that knowledge in your own system
- continue with the ROKU example, has all kinds of boxes
- when the price has been consolidating in a huge zone for months on end, we know the first move will be explosive
- the problem is we don't know when the move will actually begin
- false breakouts are a major risk with the box breakouts

Aayush Questions:
- do you need lower than 1 day timeframes to draw boxes?
- do you need moving average indicators to draw the boxes?

defining resistence levels

- y/price distance between the highs

in the case of Roku, this difference is significant, which makes it hard to consider as part of the same resistence level

we have 176.55 168.85

in the case of the 176.55 bar, there's only one bar that consists outside of the resistence level, so that may influence the determination

we have the x-distance, or time, in between the resistence tests

there's the empty space between the resistence tests (literal chart volume consisting of x-distance and y-distance that may influence the closeness determination

while these two mid-term maximas might not be that close, they may be considered "closer" considering that the price did not teeter around
the resistence line and instead swung away from it most of the time, therefore it had a major gap in space in terms of price and time.


does the fact that the three bars preceding the highest bar all had demonstrated resistence at that level before the next bar broke out?

157.22 169.7 169.45 170.97 176.55 158.8

questions to :
- what's the exact output of the filter
- do you need moving average indicators to draw the boxes?

Next steps:
- converting max difference/min retrace parameters to be a function of recent volatility (e.g. average daily range, max range over past n days / price)
- validate across full dataset for ROKU, then for many different instruments
- experiment with using different parameters for the inner S/R levels vs the outer levels of the box if necessary
- determine what the precise output of the filter should be and make it work across all necessary instruments (top 20 stocks for each sector)

## goal:

find the parameters that minimize the error between the images and the properly drawn boxes

================
I have an optimization problem.

I have a model w/ multiple parameters and I need to find the optimal set of parameters to minimize the error.

Does a neural network make sense in this case?

If so, does it make sense that the NN should have to run the program for every training step in order to generate the output and measure the error, then backprop the parameters?

If I were to create the training data before hand, then finding the optimal parameters would be simply a matter of finding whichever training sample that has the lower error rate.
I suppose it would make sense if I needed the NN to predict what the error would be for a given set of parameters, but I don't so perhaps a NN is not the right solution.
