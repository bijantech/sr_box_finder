zone to zone trading

- identifying support/resistance levels
- a price level that's important on a higher time frame is equally if not more important on a lower timeframe
- that's why we start analysis on weekly chart, then we go lower

- path of least resistence



box1:

2:00 - what are zones
6:08 - boxes define the periods in time where the asset is not trending
and helps us define the price range in which its not trending


Aayush Questions:
- do you need lower than 1 day timeframes to draw boxes?

defining resistence levels

- y/price distance between the highs

in the case of Roku, this difference is significant, which makes it hard to consider as part of the same resistence level

we have 176.55 168.85

in the case of the 176.55 bar, there's only one bar that consists outside of the resistence level, so that may influence the determination

we have the x-distance, or time, in between the resistence tests

there's the empty space between the resistence tests (literal chart volume consisting of x-distance and y-distance that may influence the closeness determination

while these two mid-term maximas might not be that close, they may be considered "closer" considering that the price did not teeter around
the resistence line and instead swung away from it most of the time, therefore it had a major gap in space in terms of price and time.


does the fact that the three bars preceding the highest bar all had demonstrated resistence at that level before the next bar broke out?

157.22 169.7 169.45 170.97 176.55 158.8
